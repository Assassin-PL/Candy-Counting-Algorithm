# Candy-Counting-Algorithm-Documentation
This project involves developing an algorithm to count correct candies placed on a rotating plate. The plate rotates in a right-hand direction, and the goal is to ensure accurate counting of candies that are not broken, fully intact, lying flat, and single (not overlapping).
